# your-plans-tonight

Imagine you are making plans for a night out. Rather than a site tht offers countless options for food and entertainment, our site makes it easy.

Imagine a mysitcal person takes into account the weather, time of year, nearby restaurants and events, and decides your fate for you.

A dinner plan and an event plan, tailor made just for you.

Employing Yelp API, Weather API, and EventBrite API, this application takes input from the user (city), and runs it through these API's. Using CSS animations, the information rolls out steadily.

The website is deployed here: https://hollywoodchase.github.io/your-plans-tonight/

Enjoy!
